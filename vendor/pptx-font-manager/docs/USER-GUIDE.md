# PowerPoint Font Manager user guide

Drop in a `.pptx`. **Find out which fonts it *actually* uses, which of those are installed here,
and take away a sidecar `.zip` that installs the rest on the machine that needs them.**

Everything happens in the browser. The deck is never uploaded anywhere.

> **Before you rely on this:** the scanner is verified against three real presentations of

> font** against the operating system's own font list on macOS.

> **The bundle's Windows installer script has never been run on Windows**; the macOS and Linux ones

## Why not just search the file for font names

**Because you get a wrong answer that looks right.**

Every PowerPoint theme carries a **script fallback table** — a list of fonts to reach for if the
deck ever contains Japanese, Devanagari, Khmer, Syriac and so on. **It is there whether or not a
single such character exists in the presentation.**

Searching a real deck for font references finds **39 fonts. It uses two.** The other 37 are that
table, and a tool that lists them will send you off to install Mongolian Baiti for a slide that says
"Welcome" in Calibri.

The second half of the problem is that **decks name *faces*, not *families***:

| The deck asks for | A naive check says | Actually |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Helvetica Neue Medium` | missing | you have it |
| `Poppins Regular` | missing | you have it |
| `Times Roman` | missing | that's Times New Roman |
| `Garamond` | missing | genuinely missing |

**Three false alarms out of four.** This tool resolves the names first, so "missing" means missing.

## What it does

**Scans** slides, layouts, masters, notes, charts and SmartArt, resolves theme references through
**the theme the slide actually inherits**, and sorts what it finds by **how much it matters** —
used on a slide, inherited from a layout or theme, or only present somewhere incidental.

**Checks what is installed**, using the browser's font-access API where it exists and text-width
measurement everywhere else.

**Finds replacements** across two catalogues — 1,942 Google Fonts families plus 119 more that
Google does not carry — matched after the name is normalised, with near-matches offered when there
is no exact one.

---

## Substitutes, and the distinction that matters

**The fonts most often missing are the ones a deck picks up just by being written on Windows or a
Mac** — Calibri, Cambria, Arial, Times New Roman, Courier New, Georgia. **None may be
redistributed** and none are on Google Fonts.

So the app offers **metric-compatible** stand-ins instead: Carlito for Calibri, Caladea for
Cambria, Arimo for Arial, Tinos for Times New Roman. **These have the same advance widths as the
original, so line breaks hold and text stays inside its box.**

Where only a **visually similar** face exists — Open Sans for Segoe UI — **it says so plainly.**
That swap *will* move your line breaks, and being told the deck is fixed when it is not is worse
than being told the font is missing.

## Adobe Fonts, and the failure that looks fine

Adobe fonts **can never be bundled** — Adobe's terms say they are not compatible with workflows
that transfer font files to another computer, and there is no API that serves the files in any
case. So for a missing one the app names the reason and links to the family page.

**The desktop app also catches the version of this that looks fine**: a font Creative Cloud syncs
onto your machine is installed *here and nowhere else*, so **the deck renders perfectly for you and
breaks at the venue.**

It is told apart from an ordinary installed font **by where its file lives** — Adobe keeps synced
faces in its own folder — which is why *Times New Roman* does not get the warning merely for being
sold on Adobe Fonts too.

## Embedded fonts

PowerPoint's "embed fonts in the file" **does not store a TTF.** It stores EOT, and what happens
next depends on who wrote the file:

| Written by | Format | Can it be recovered? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PowerPoint | EOT + MicroType Express | **No** — the glyph data is compressed |
| Canva, LibreOffice | EOT, uncompressed | **Yes** — extracted as a valid TTF |

**Either way the font travels with the deck**, so it will render wherever the `.pptx` goes. The
distinction only matters for what can go in the bundle.

---

## The bundle, and the two traps it heads off

There is no such thing as a single self-extracting archive that runs on every OS, so the bundle is
a plain `.zip` with **one small script per platform**, a manifest saying where each font came from
and under what licence, and a README covering the two ways these normally fail:

- **macOS Gatekeeper.** Anything extracted from a downloaded zip inherits a quarantine flag, and
  double-clicking the installer gets "cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified
  developer". **That is not a broken script.** The README gives both ways through, plus the
  no-script route of dropping the fonts on Font Book.
- **Windows Mark-of-the-Web.** PowerShell refuses to run a script that came out of a downloaded
  archive, for the same reason.

The installers write to the **per-user font directory**, so no administrator password is needed.

## If something is wrong

| Symptom | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| **A font is listed as missing and I have it** | Should be rare — names are resolved to families first. Check whether it is a Creative Cloud sync. |
| **I installed the font while this page was open, and it still says missing** (Windows) | Chrome and Edge read the Windows font list only when they start — a reload does not help. Close the browser completely (Edge also runs on in the taskbar tray) and reopen. PowerPoint sees the font straight away. |
| **The installer will not run** | Gatekeeper or Mark-of-the-Web. The bundle's README covers both, and Font Book needs no script at all. |
| **An embedded font could not be extracted** | It is PowerPoint's compressed EOT. It still travels with the deck. |
| **A substitution moved my line breaks** | It was a visually similar face, not a metric-compatible one. The app says which. |
| **An Adobe font is not offered** | It cannot be bundled. Activate it through Creative Cloud on the target machine. |
