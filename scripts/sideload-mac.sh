#   scripts/sideload-mac.sh --hosted   # the production manifest, verbatim
#
# manifest.xml in the repo is the PRODUCTION manifest (see its header). The dev
# copy is derived here by rewriting the hosted origin to the vite dev server,
# so the two can never drift apart in the repo — there is only one file. For
# the dev copy the dev server (npm run dev) must be running and its cert
# trusted (npm run certs).
#
# Both copies carry the same add-in <Id>, so PowerPoint treats them as the same
# add-in: sideload one or the other, never both at once.
#
# NOTE: the custom Home-tab button may only appear after you launch the add-in
# once from  Home ▸ Add-ins ▸ Developer Add-ins ▸ Font Manager  — a known
# wef-sideload quirk. After that first launch the ribbon button sticks.
